Introduction
Freedom is the key to humanity's progress. Blockchain, crypto, and
self-custodial wallets are very powerful because they free people
ﬁnancially. With them sending or receiving digital value, swapping
different currencies, and staking money to earn more, without needing
to be validated or trusted by a central ﬁnancial institution is now possible.
However, when users are willing to do a peer-to-peer crypto transaction
for exchanging goods or services using this new technology there is a
high risk of fraud because transactions in the blockchain are
decentralized, anonymous, and irreversible.
A smart contract is a piece of software that is hosted in the blockchain
and can be coded for executing many different functions that are visible
and transparent to anyone, as the code is public in the blockchain. The
functions that each smart contract has, can be controlled by the wallets
that connect to them.
A smart contract escrow can hold the value between buyer and seller, as
a third party in the middle, providing security, transparency, and control
over the transaction until the transfer of good or service that is being
exchanged between the peers is successfully completed and validated
by them.

The smart contract is a piece of code, that is controlled by the wallet of the buyer and the wallet
of the seller, it is not a centralized institution. paydece has no control over the funds the user
escrows using the smart contract.

Users connect to the Dapp with their wallet where they own their private
keys (they have total control over their funds) and will block their funds in
a smart contract that will hold the value until the transaction of the good

i. How does it work?
Two users want to exchange any good or service using crypto as the
payment method. They agree to use paydece decentralized escrow so
that the buyer will ensure that he will receive the good or service and the
seller ensures that he will receive the money. Funds will remain in the
smart contract until both sides validate.
Video DEMO.
1.

Users connect using their self-custodial wallet once they agree they
will exchange the good or service, they set the price, the exchange
conditions & terms, etc.

2.

The seller creates an invoice by completing the required information
and sending the invoice (link) to the buyer.

3.

The buyer adds the invoice to his dashboard and creates the escrow
(smart contract). Then he sends the crypto to the smart contract.

4.

The smart contract escrow will hold the funds of the buyer in the
middle of both wallets.

5.

The seller will send the product to the buyer (he knows that the
crypto is escrowed and they cannot move unless he validates it) or do
the service they previously agreed to. Once he transfers the goods or
ﬁnishes the service, he validates (pressing the validation button in
the Dapp).

6.

The buyer receives the good and validates it, the same way.

7.

The funds are released when both sides validate the transaction was
successfully done.

i.i Disputes:
If there is any problem during the transaction, meaning that the funds
are escrowed but one of the sides doesn't validate, a dispute is raised.
paydece at the ﬁrst stage (resolution of conﬂicts) can solve it and decide
the side the funds will move to. If the dispute escalates and a complete
legal framework is needed Kleros.io, a decentralized arbitration system
will be used for ﬁnding the ﬁnal resolution.

ii. Characteristics
� A Dapp, users can connect from any corner of the world using their
self-custodial wallet. The smart contract is 100% in the blockchain.
Similar characteristics and look & feel to Uniswap (or any web 3
decentralized protocol).
� The smart contract escrow is EVM compatible and can be launched
and used in every EVM blockchain. It works with Ethereum, BNB smart
chain, Polygon, and Rootstock (more blockchains including payments
with bitcoin in the future will be added).
� The protocol works with stablecoins that include USDT, BUSD, USDC,
and others. A new feature for payments using each native blockchain
coin will be available.
� Users can connect using MetaMask, Coinbase wallet, and more than
150 other blockchain wallets. paydece is a wallet-connect compatible
protocol.
� The app can be used in Spanish and English language.
� The smart contract charges a commission fee (0,5%) or the total
amount of the money for every transaction done.
� A smart contract audit was done by hacken.io for ensuring that
security, functionality, and communication are correct and transparent.
The ﬁnal score was 9.5/10.

iii. Technical Information.
This smart contract implements an
escrow service for cryptocurrency
transactions. It allows the creation
of an escrow for a given order,
where a buyer and a seller can
deposit their funds, which are held
by the contract until the
transaction is completed or a
dispute is resolved. The contract
can be used to hold funds in
different currencies, as long as they
are ERC20 tokens. The contract
deﬁnes a structure called Escrow to
represent an escrow, which
contains the addresses of the buyer
and seller, the value of the
transaction, the commissions for
the buyer and seller, the currency
used, and the status of the escrow.
The contract also maintains a
correspondence between the order
ID and the escrow to store the
escrows that have been created.
The contract has a
whitelistedStablesAddresses

assignment to store a list of
whitelisted stablecoin addresses
and checks that the currency used
in an escrow is a whitelisted
stablecoin before creating the
escrow. There is also a
feesAvailable assignment to track
fees that can be withdrawn, and a
feesAvailableNativeCoin variable to
track fees that can be withdrawn in
the native currency (presumably
ETH). The contract has a modiﬁer
onlyBuyer and onlySeller to restrict
certain functions to be called only
by the escrow buyer or seller,
respectively. It also has an
onlyOwner modiﬁer to restrict
certain functions to be called only
by the contract owner. The
contract has a base contract
Ownable, which provides an
onlyOwner modiﬁer and an owner
address to store the address of the
contract owner.

v. Tokenomics.
The Paydece Token Economy has been built based on the following
guidelines:
A Single Token model: The engine of Paydece's economy will be its
protocol Token under the acronym PDC. It is pre-mined with a limited
supply of 200M token units (no more units will be issued than those
already issued). It will have various functionalities and utilities.
A distribution of pre-mined tokens designed for decentralization where
the community will be the recipient of the most signiﬁcant number of
units, accompanied by a vesting structure where the Founders, investors,
and the team are those who have the most rigid lock pointing to a
commitment of the main actors.
A deﬂationary monetary policy:
1) With emissions at a decreasing rate that are halved every two years.
Stage 1: growth/inﬂationary,
Stage 2: consolidation and maturity,
Stage 3: Deﬂationary.
2) A token-burning mechanism proportional to the demand, use, and
interaction with the protocol, of gradual and hybrid application (manual
off-chain and automatic on-chain).
A sustainable Business Model aligned to a healthy economy token.

freedom & security
in P2P transactions.

14

PDC Token:
Acronym: PDC
Type: Protocol token (Type 2 Dapp)
Liquidity: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB chain, and Rootstock.
Smart Contracts: (paydece.io - iv)
Supply: 200M units (No more units than those deﬁned will be issued).
Being the only protocol token and engine of the Payedece economy,
multiple functionalities and utilities have been assigned to it, namely,
making it an asset of value, attractive to all users of the ecosystem, and
with a projection that in the long term for that can operate and be sued
outside of Paydece's ecosystem.
Functionalities and utility:
Governance token: To be implemented under a gradual process, with the
following stages:
� Stage 1: Complete centralization - the team has complete control over
the project, and there is no voting. There will be unexpected events that
require immediate reviews and corrections that cannot be done
democratically (limited time).
� Stage 2: Semi-decentralization - the team still has full control of the
project and can implement revisions. However, the community can be
involved in non-urgent decisions, providing input through a forum and
off-chain voting system.
� Stage 3: Full decentralization - the project becomes fully decentralized,
all decisions are made through a strict procedure, and all voting is done
on-chain.

Exchange value and payment currency:
The PDC token can be purchased in a public market; available exchanges
at market prices as long as liquidity allows it (In some cases and intervals
the user may ﬁnd himself with slippage and therefore price signiﬁcant
impact). Ultimately it will be a free trade exchange within the blockchain.
Users will be able to transact with PDC to acquire other cryptocurrencies
or FIAT money, products, services, payment of salaries to the team, and
more. Choosing the PDC as the transaction currency will have the beneﬁt
of discounts or cashback depending on the case when using paydece
escrow for transactions.
Toll: Refers to the battery of gas fees, network toll, commissions, etc. that
can be presented in the use of the protocol, as well as penalties (Penalty
Fee) for example for early withdrawal of capital compromised by any
other breach of clauses, the Dispute fee of 23 USD from Kleros, some
other sanction for improper behavior of the user, etc, all through the
PDC token.
Rewards: Payment of the rewards of the Bounty Program for the
detection of bugs or possible improvements and everything that can be
part of increasing the user experience providing PDC as a reward. Also,
using Airdrops modality for those who fulﬁll certain tasks such as
following Paydece on the networks, likes, retweets, contributing to add
content, making memes or NFTs, even being active in Discord,
participating in Twitter Spaces, qualifying users, paydecers of the month,
etc.
In turn, Paydece will have an exclusive DeFi Platform for those users who
voluntarily choose to add liquidity to the PDC/USDT pair (Par as an
example) or choose to block capital that contributes to increasing the T
VL (“STAKING”), in all cases will be rewarded in PDC at attractive rates of
return.

Token distribution and vesting structure:
In order to provide the entire ecosystem with security, transparency, and
decentralization, to avoid unexpected movements in the PDC price, there
has to be a correspondence between the value that the product provides
with the attractiveness that the user keeps and does not sell the token
(hold and use) and its price, our tokenomists have deﬁned the following
stakeholders, the amount of PDC they will receive and their corresponding
release policy (amount and times) of the assigned tokens (vesting).

PDC emitions and projections:
The PDC is a protocol token that is pre-mined, so its emissions and its
progressive appearance in circulation are directly related to the deﬁned
vesting structure. As long as the PDCs are stored in the contract that
gave rise to them, these units will not be part of the working capital.
Depending on the vesting structure, plus other relevant variables a
projection was established in which the appearance of the PDCs in the
currency can create. Supply is an item of great relevance within monetary
policy and plays a crucial role in the health of the economy and the
sustainability of the protocol and its business model.
The issues were designed with a decreasing rate model within a
deﬂationary monetary policy following the line and current of the
Paydece tokenomist.
In the following table and graph, we can see the emission projections
taking an analysis period of 8 years counting from the public release of
the token and as relevant aspects, we can mention the following:
For the community (creditor of half of the total tokens) an issuance limit
of 0.05% per day was established for the ﬁrst 2 years, then through a kind
of "halving" reducing them to half for the following 2 years (0.025%) and
so on every two years.
In the areas of Founders and equipment, Private Sale, and Public Sale,
the issues will be fully in circulation in the analysis period taken (8 years).
In the Community, Foundation, and Marketing areas, during the 8-year
period taken for the projections, 32.5%, 44%, and 47% will remain if the
assigned PDCs are issued.
According to the projection, by the end of year 8, there will be
149,828,000 PDCs in circulation, which represents 74.91% of the total
pre-mined tokens in gross quantity, since those tokens that are going
to be burned during the mentioned period are not being taken into
account.

PDC token burning mechanism:
Within the monetary policy deﬁned of a deﬂationary nature, a mechanism
for burning tokens has been established. It will be implemented gradually
with respect to decentralization in burning decisions, following the same
line of gradualism to be implemented for the governance of the protocol,
where a hybrid modality of off-chain manual burning and on-chain
automatic programmed burning will be applied.
The projected structure for burning the PDC token has deﬁned
guidelines and when we move on to the particular instance of precise
construction and decisions, they will be as follows:
� The burning of tokens is a highly relevant item of the deﬂationary monetary policy derived from a token economy raised from the general to
the particular.
� Token burning mechanism that tends to decentralization with the
gradual implementation of the objective aligned to the same model,
rhythm and times of the DAO and its Governance System.
� Hybrid burning system ON CHAIN and OFF CHAIN (manual and automatic)
� A speciﬁc burning wallet will be established that will be the destination
for all purposes of the burned tokens will be stored, they cannot be
reused or reincorporated into circulation.
� A "buybacks and burn" mechanism will also be established, where in a
previous step the PDCs are repurchased in the Market and then those
units travel to the burn wallet.
� As stated in the Vesting Structure, PDCs that are not sold in the Private
Sale will be sent to the burn wallet.
� The units that are burned will mainly come from the transactions that
occur during the normal and usual operation of the protocol. An example may be the following: In a PDC/USDT swap: The user pays 1%, 0.5%
of that swap is divided into 0.4% to add to the pair's Liquidity Pool and
0.1 % for token burning. The remaining 0.5% that the user pays is divided into 0.4% to pay liquidity providers and the remaining 0.1% goes to
token burning.
� Another source of burning may come directly from PDCs stored in the
Foundation vault if necessary. For example, applying the buy and burn
technique.
� The variables associated with the different types of burning will be
deﬁned: Periodic burning (Periodicity - time unit). Burn based on usage
(Percentage of transactions and their types) Burn based on price (from
a certain threshold or percentage deviation). Burning of inactive tokens
(those that are detected as not being used for a certain time and are
subject to a certain condition).

vi. Attributes that empower
paydece:
� Highly scalable: The solution created and owned by users fully works in
the blockchain.
� Zero operative cost: Each transaction is paid and controlled by users
wallets.
� Easy business model: For each transaction done, the smart contract
automatically charges the commission fee.
� Gigantic market: Real use case for self-custodial wallets. Any user can
buy any good with their wallet.
� Low barriers to users to entry: Self-custodial wallet created in less
than one minute.
� Viral growth: For using the solution both peers have to agree ﬁrst, so
users that enjoy paydece are salesforce because they have to teach
others how to use the protocol.
� Low bureaucracy: The transaction is fully between peers.
� Historical timing: Blockchain applied to ﬁnance is massively growing
in adoption, but today it is in a very early stage.
� Real use case: Users can use the money they hold in self-custodial
wallets to buy or sell goods in real life.
� Clear vision: Satoshi Nakamoto's disciples, helps to decide the next
steps the startup has to take in development, marketing, compliance,
etc.

i. Crypto to FIAT P2P trading
paydece is a decentralized escrow that can be used between peers to
exchange any kind of goods because the Dapp always works in the same
way. Cryptos are escrowed (blocked) between buyer and seller, they
exchange what they previously agree and they release once the
transaction of the good they are exchanging is successfully done.
Since launch, the main use case our users decided to use paydece is the
crypto to FIAT exchange. Although it is not a market that paydece
believes will continue to be in the long term, it is the way to continue
building traction and revenue. The objective in this bear market is to
obtain traction and break even in early 2023. Great success will come in
the next bull market.
Once this milestone is reached, paydece will continue developing the
solution for other use cases: a marketplace of retail products & services, a
marketplace of cars, a marketplace for real estate, and a marketplace for
goods in the metaverse.

freedom & security
in P2P transactions.

25

The solution works the following way:
1.

With referrals link, YouTubers, communities, worth of mouth, and
web3 newspapers, paydece decentralized escrow is got to know by
the web3 users.

2.

Users join the telegram group that is divided by the main P2P
countries of Latam. They upload the order of buying or selling crypto
in their country using the bot.

3.

There is when the offer and the demand are joined. Once they agree
on the terms of the transaction the buyer of the crypto creates the
invoice and sends it to the seller.

4.

The seller sends the crypto to the escrow. Once crypto is blocked the
buyer sends the ﬁat to the buyer and validates it.

5.

When the seller receives the FIAT releases the crypto to the buyer.

For having a clear view of the market size of the ﬁrst stage go-to-market
strategy that includes, P2P crypto to ﬁat trading, Remittances in crypto,
and On/Off P2P ramp some numbers are shared below.

26

ii. P2P crypto market
The decentralized escrow can be used in many different ways, but the
ﬁrst product market ﬁt was in P2P crypto to FIAT trading. A market size
study was done to have an idea of whether the market is big enough.
A ChainAnalysis report conﬁrmed that the total crypto value received
from July 21 to July 22 in Latin America and Spain was 662Bn USD (Total
Addressable Market). If this number is converted to de Decentralized
Finance (users that operate directly in the blockchain owning the private
keys) the Serviceable Available Market is 159 Bn USD. Finally, the
estimated Serviceable Obtainable Market is of 1.16Bn USD.
From a self-made study with information obtained from SimilarWeb, the
number of possibles users located in Spain, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia,
and Venezuela on average was greater than 6.000.000 users.

27

iii. Product market fit

Volume escrowed per month since launch, April 22 to November 22.
In the ﬁrst month of the escrow launch, there was a total amount of
281.606 USD escrowed in 33 transactions. This included a 100.000 USD
ﬁat to crypto transaction of paydece, for turning the cash of investment
into crypto.
From May to July the number of escrows created increased - in May there
were fewer escrows than in April - from 6 to 37 in July. During those
months many different products were transacted:
� Land in the metaverse.
� Real Estate.
� Jewelry.
� Electronics devices.
� Remittances.
� Argentinian food.
� Coat.
But the main use case was the peer to peer crypto to FIAT decentralized
exchange.

freedom & security
in P2P transactions.

28

paydece is a solution created so that users can use crypto to buy or sell
goods, any kind of them. But from launch to July the main use case was
the exchange of crypto to FIAT. In paydece the team knew that the
solution was not focused on that niche, so they decided to create a QR for
direct payments in crypto. An ideal solution for buying goods in physical,
retail commerce. One hundred percent of the energy started to be
focused on QR direct payments.
During those two months, the results were very bad. Zero transactions
were done using the QR payment method and less than 1.000 USD were
escrowed in August and September. With these results, the decision was
to return to the FIAT to crypto exchange.
Good results were quickly achieved. In October product market ﬁt was
obtained (almost 3 transactions per day and more than 188.000 USD
escrowed that month). paydece was a solution that allowed users to
exchange crypto to FIAT in a decentralized way.
From October to November, a commission fee for every transaction done
started to be charged and the number of escrows created continued to
increase (almost double amounts of escrows created in November than
in October). The commission fee charged is 0,1% of the total amount of
the transaction, this number will increase to 0,5% and 1% in the ﬁrst half
of 2023.

29

iv. Learning since launch
Users ﬁnd the solution very useful as a middle third party that provides
security and transparency in the P2P crypto to FIAT decentralized
transactions. Most of the users once they understand how paydece
works, they stop to use other centralized solutions. Because paydece
has no KYC, has low bureaucracy, and is decentralized users prefer it
among others..
� Users love the effect created when validating each step during the
transaction, they want to have control of the funds. paydece has a good
wow effect (that has to continue being improved) when funds are
released.
� Users being paydece ambassadors “paydecers” is the best way to grow,
rewarding users to spread the solution in their communities builds
more trust in our new users than doing traditional marketing.
� A place where the offer and the demand are joined is needed. Without
this place, it is difﬁcult to unite the buyer and the seller. Telegram
group today works as the place where the crypto buyer and sellers join.
A marketplace integrated into the app is being developed for
improving user experience.
� User learning curve:
� They made a little USD amount transaction to try if the solution works.
� They do one complete crypto-to-FIAT transaction.
� They understand that with paydece they can exchange whatever they
want because crypto is escrowed and between peers, they exchange
any good they previously agree.
� The percentage of disputes was 0,7% (3 from 394 transactions - Nov22).
One dispute was by mistake, another one was because of a problem
with the bank (no bad intention of the user). Only one dispute was
raised and a scammer was identiﬁed. The problem was easily solved
because the scammer was not willing to contribute information.

Conclusion
We are facing an opportunity. Blockchain technology is revolutionizing
the world as the internet did it. For storing data, information, or value
there is no more need for trust in a central institution because
decentralized networks can now do this job. This raises the speed of value
exchange, simpliﬁes and reduces the steps needed to do online
transactions, discards geographical or time limits reduces costs because
it lowers the bureaucracy, and also reduces friction between the parties
involved. These are some of the reasons why we know that surely this
technology will be soon, massively adopted. Creating a self-custodial
wallet and start using it takes less time than creating a new email
account.
Crypto is the future simply because it makes users' lives easier, reducing
friction, bureaucracy, fees, cost, and time. Central ﬁnancial institutions
will be left behind because people already know that they can not trust
them. Frauds (FTX collapse), scams (LunaTerra collapse), and inﬂation
(during all human history) are examples of this.
paydece conﬁrmed that there are early adopters willing to do their
transactions trusting in smart contracts other than on a central
institution. Now is the time to continue improving and scaling the
solution to every corner of the world. The future of ﬁnance is here,
welcome to the evolution of transactions.
